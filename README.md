## TinyML Data Exploration & Machine Learning

Data Exploration of acceleration and gyroscope data from ESP32 with MPU6500 sensor. 

Data collected from the device was used to train an ML model that runs on the ESP32. The ML model and code on ESP32 is implemented in pure(Python).

A detailed walkthrough in the blog below.
